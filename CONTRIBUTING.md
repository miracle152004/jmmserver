# Reporting Issues

First off, make sure the issue you are reporting is about JMM Server, not JMM Desktop. It's easy to confuse the two when it comes to functionality. JMM Server handles all the **backend** functions while JMM Desktop handles all the **frontend** functions. 

Here are some examples: 

* Want to see a new feature added? Most likely JMM Desktop related.
* Problems with hashing? JMM Server related. 
* Connecting to MAL or Trakt? JMM Desktop related.
* Image download problems? JMM Server related.
* Change how many images are downloaded? JMM Desktop related. 

Hopefully these examples help point you in the right direction. Also please make sure your report contains all the information we'll need to replicate the issue.
